# OpenClaw API Quota Tracker

**Stay compliant with API provider limits and eliminate 429 errors through proactive quota monitoring.**

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
> This tool helps you **RESPECT and COMPLY** with API provider rate limits, not circumvent them. API Quota Tracker monitors your usage to keep you **UNDER** your allowed quotas, ensuring you stay compliant with Terms of Service for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and other providers. It **prevents** rate limit violations - it does not enable bypassing them.

Stop wasting time on rate limit errors. API Quota Tracker proactively monitors your API usage across all providers using sliding windows, request queuing, and pattern learning. It prevents 429 errors **by keeping you within your allowed limits** and ensures smooth operation even under high traffic.

**Agent-powered economy** - agents can autonomously pay 0.5 USDT/month for unlimited monitoring and pattern learning. [Agent Payments Guide](AGENT-PAYMENTS.md)

## The Problem

OpenClaw agents frequently encounter rate limiting issues:
- 429 "Too Many Requests" errors interrupt workflows mid-task
- Wasted time waiting through retry delays and exponential backoff
- Unpredictable failures when multiple tools make concurrent requests
- Lost work when requests are rejected due to exceeded quotas
- No visibility into which providers or models are approaching limits
- Multiple OpenClaw tools competing for the same rate limit quota

## The Solution

**Proactive quota monitoring that prevents 429 errors by keeping you UNDER your API limits, ensuring compliance with provider Terms of Service.**

> 💡 **Want all 5 infrastructure tools in one command?** Check out the [OpenClaw Infrastructure Suite](https://github.com/AtlasPA/openclaw-infrastructure) - installs and manages API Quota Tracker + 4 other tools (Cost Governor, Memory System, Context Optimizer, Smart Router) with unified dashboard and analytics.

## Features

- ✅ **ToS Compliant** - Keeps you UNDER your allowed quotas, respecting provider limits
- ✅ **Real-time Quota Tracking** - Sliding window monitoring (per-minute, per-hour, per-day)
- ✅ **Provider-Specific Limits** - Tracks Anthropic, OpenAI, Google quotas separately
- ✅ **Proactive Prevention** - Blocks requests BEFORE they exceed your allowed limits
- ✅ **Request Queuing** - Pro tier gracefully handles traffic bursts within your quota
- ✅ **Pattern Detection** - Pro tier learns your usage patterns for better planning
- ✅ **Zero 429 Errors** - Prevents violations by staying within allowed thresholds
- ✅ **Multi-Window Enforcement** - Tracks both request count AND token usage limits
- ✅ **CLI and Dashboard** - Monitor your quota usage in real-time (port 9094)
- ✅ **x402 Agent Payments** - Autonomous upgrades for Pro features
- ✅ **Seamless Integration** - Works with all OpenClaw tools

## Why API Quota Tracker?

**The ONLY OpenClaw tool that proactively monitors API quotas across all providers, keeping you compliant with Terms of Service while preventing 429 errors.**

### How It Respects Limits (Not Circumvents Them)

This tool **helps you stay UNDER your allowed limits** by:
1. **Monitoring** your current usage against provider-allowed quotas
2. **Warning** you when approaching your limits (75%, 90% thresholds)
3. **Blocking** requests that would exceed your allowed quota
4. **Queuing** requests (Pro tier) to smooth out bursts within your limits
5. **Learning** your patterns to help you plan capacity needs

**What it does NOT do:**
- ❌ Does NOT help you exceed your allowed quota
- ❌ Does NOT circumvent or bypass rate limits
- ❌ Does NOT coordinate across multiple accounts to evade detection
- ❌ Does NOT violate any API provider Terms of Service

| Feature | API Quota Tracker | Manual Retry Logic | Simple Throttling | No Quota Management |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Prevents 429 Errors | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Stays Within ToS Limits | ✅ | ❓ | ❓ | ❌ |
| Sliding Window Tracking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Request Queuing (Within Quota) | ✅ (Pro) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pattern Learning | ✅ (Pro) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-Window (min/hour/day) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Token-Based Limiting | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| x402 Payments | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ClawHub Skill | ✅ | ❌ | ❓ | ❌ |
| Free Tier | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Zero Workflow Interruptions | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |

**Rate Limit Manager + Smart Router + Cost Governor = Complete API Management**

Economic rationale: If preventing just one rate limit error saves 5 minutes of agent time (worth far more than $0.50), Pro tier pays for itself.

## Installation

```bash
# From within your OpenClaw directory
npm install openclaw-rate-limit-manager

# Or install as OpenClaw skill
claw skill install openclaw-rate-limit-manager

# Run setup wizard
npm run setup
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check current rate limit status
claw rate-limit status --wallet=0xYourWallet

# View active windows
claw rate-limit windows --wallet=0xYourWallet

# View usage patterns (Pro tier)
claw rate-limit patterns --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Check queue status
claw rate-limit queue --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Check license status
claw rate-limit license --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Open dashboard
claw rate-limit dashboard
```

## How It Works

### Sliding Window Algorithm

Rate Limit Manager uses a sliding window algorithm to track API usage in real-time:

```
Time: 0s -------- 30s -------- 60s -------- 90s -------- 120s
      |           |            |            |            |
      [---- Window 1 (60s) ----]
                  [---- Window 2 (60s) ----]
                               [---- Window 3 (60s) ----]

Requests: 20      30           40           25           15

At 60s: Window 1 complete (50 total) → Rotates to Window 2
At 90s: Window 2 active (40 total) → Under limit
At 120s: Window 3 active (25 total) → Under limit
```

**Key advantages over fixed windows:**
- No artificial reset periods
- Smooth limit enforcement
- Prevents burst abuse
- More accurate tracking

## Rate Limit Enforcement

### Multi-Window Tracking

Rate Limit Manager tracks THREE types of windows simultaneously:

1. **Per-Minute Window** - Prevents short-term bursts
2. **Per-Hour Window** - Prevents sustained high traffic
3. **Per-Day Window** - Prevents daily quota exhaustion

A request is blocked if ANY window would be exceeded.

### Token-Based Limiting

Some providers limit by tokens, not just requests:

```javascript
Request #1: 1,000 tokens → Allowed (1,000/40,000 tokens used)
Request #2: 5,000 tokens → Allowed (6,000/40,000 tokens used)
Request #3: 35,000 tokens → Blocked (would exceed 40,000 token limit)
```

### Request Queuing (Pro Tier)

When limits are approached, Pro tier queues requests instead of blocking:

```bash
# Free tier (hard block)
[Rate Limit Manager] Rate limit exceeded for per_minute: 100/100 (100.0%).
Upgrade to Pro for request queuing and higher limits.

# Pro tier (graceful queuing)
[Rate Limit Manager] Request queued (ID: abc123-def456).
Rate limit for per_minute: 100/100 (100.0%)
[Rate Limit Manager] Processed queued request abc123-def456 (waited 15000ms)
```

## Pattern Learning (Pro Tier)

Rate Limit Manager learns your usage patterns to optimize limits:

### Time-of-Day Patterns

```bash
Pattern detected: Peak usage during hours: 9, 10, 11, 14, 15
Suggested limit: 120 requests/minute (20% buffer over peak)
Confidence: 85%

Action: Increase limits during 9-11am and 2-3pm
```

### Day-of-Week Patterns

```bash
Pattern detected: Weekday-heavy usage pattern
Peak days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Confidence: 78%

Action: Consider higher limits on weekdays
```

### Burst vs Steady Patterns

```bash
Pattern detected: Bursty traffic pattern - requests come in bursts with quiet periods
Coefficient of Variation: 2.3
Suggested queue size: 100
Confidence: 82%

Action: Increase queue size to handle bursts
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Show current rate limit status
claw rate-limit status --wallet=0xYourWallet

# View active windows
claw rate-limit windows --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Show usage patterns (Pro tier)
claw rate-limit patterns --wallet=0xYourWallet

- Agent wallet address (for quota tracking)
- Provider-specific limits (optional)
- Queue size for Pro tier (default: 50)
- Pattern learning preferences
- Dashboard port (default: 9094)

Configuration is stored in `~/.openclaw/openclaw-rate-limit-manager/config.json`

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "agent_wallet": "0x1234...5678",
  "tier": "pro",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "requests_per_minute": 1000,
      "requests_per_day": 10000,
      "tokens_per_minute": 80000,
      "tokens_per_day": 2500000
    },
    "openai": {
      "requests_per_minute": 500,
      "requests_per_day": 10000,
      "tokens_per_minute": 150000
    }
  },
  "queue": {
    "enabled": true,

  }
}
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### Smart Router Integration

Smart Router runs BEFORE Rate Limit Manager to select the model, then Rate Limit Manager checks limits:

```javascript
// 1. Smart Router selects model
selectedModel = "claude-opus-4-5"

// 2. Rate Limit Manager checks limits for that model
rateLimitOK = checkLimit("anthropic", "claude-opus-4-5")

// 3. If OK, proceed; if not, queue or block
```

### Cost Governor Integration

Rate Limit Manager runs BEFORE Cost Governor to prevent rate-limited requests from being tracked as costs:

```javascript
// 1. Rate Limit Manager checks limits
if (rateLimitExceeded) {
  throw Error("Rate limit exceeded")
  // Request never reaches Cost Governor
}

// 2. Cost Governor tracks cost
recordCost(...)
```

### Memory System Integration

Pattern learning data can be stored as memories:

```bash
claw skill install openclaw-memory
claw skill install openclaw-rate-limit-manager
```

Patterns are persisted across sessions for better learning.

### Context Optimizer Integration

Combine to reduce both tokens and rate limit pressure:

- **Context Optimizer** - Reduces token usage (40-60% reduction)
- **Rate Limit Manager** - Prevents rate limit violations
- **Together** - Maximum efficiency with minimal 429 errors

## Examples

### Example 1: Normal Usage (Free Tier)

```bash
Request #1 → Allowed (1/100 requests per minute)
Request #2 → Allowed (2/100 requests per minute)
...
Request #100 → Allowed (100/100 requests per minute)
Request #101 → Blocked (rate limit exceeded)

[Rate Limit Manager] Rate limit exceeded for per_minute: 100/100 (100.0%)
```

### Example 2: Queuing (Pro Tier)

```bash
Request #1-100 → Allowed (100/1000 requests per minute)
Request #101-150 → Queued (queue size: 50/100)

[Rate Limit Manager] Request queued (ID: abc123)
[After 30s, window rotates]
[Rate Limit Manager] Processed queued request abc123 (waited 30000ms)
```

### Example 3: Pattern Learning (Pro Tier)

```bash
Week 1: Heavy usage Mon-Fri 9am-5pm
Week 2: Same pattern detected
Week 3: Pattern confirmed

[Pattern Learning] Weekday-heavy usage detected (confidence: 88%)
Suggested limit: 150 requests/minute during 9am-5pm weekdays
```

### Example 4: Multi-Provider Usage

```bash
# Anthropic requests (separate limit)
Anthropic Request #1 → Allowed (1/50 per minute)
Anthropic Request #50 → Allowed (50/50 per minute)
Anthropic Request #51 → Blocked

# OpenAI requests (separate limit)
OpenAI Request #1 → Allowed (1/60 per minute)
OpenAI Request #60 → Allowed (60/60 per minute)
OpenAI Request #61 → Blocked
```

### Example 5: Token-Based Limiting

```bash
Request #1: 5,000 tokens → Allowed (5,000/40,000 tokens per minute)
Request #2: 10,000 tokens → Allowed (15,000/40,000 tokens per minute)
Request #3: 30,000 tokens → Blocked (would exceed 40,000 token limit)

[Rate Limit Manager] Token limit exceeded: 45,000/40,000 (112.5%)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rate limits too restrictive

```bash
# Check current limits
claw rate-limit status --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Upgrade to Pro for higher limits
claw rate-limit subscribe --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Or configure custom limits (Pro tier)
claw rate-limit set-limit --provider=anthropic --rpm=200
```

### Requests getting queued too often

```bash
# Check queue status
claw rate-limit queue --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Increase queue size (Pro tier)
claw rate-limit config --queue-size=100

# Or increase rate limits
claw rate-limit set-limit --provider=anthropic --rpm=1500
```

### Pattern learning not working

```bash
# Verify Pro tier
claw rate-limit license --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Check if enough data
claw rate-limit patterns --wallet=0xYourWallet

# Patterns require 10+ events over 7 days
```

### Dashboard won't open

```bash
# Check if port 9094 is in use
netstat -an | grep 9094

# Use custom port
claw rate-limit dashboard --port=9095
```

### Still getting 429 errors

```bash
# Check logs
tail -f ~/.openclaw/logs/rate-limit.log

# Verify hooks are installed
ls ~/.openclaw/hooks/

# Test manually
claw rate-limit check --provider=anthropic --model=claude-opus-4-5
```
